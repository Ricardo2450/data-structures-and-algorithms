# Hashtable
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- A table that refers to a key and a value

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:
- set
- get
- has
- keys
- hash


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Just use the code we did in class and work with that. Also made test outlined in the Code Challenge

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
- Set will hash the key and set the key and value pair.
- get will return the value associated with that key
- has determines if the key exists in the table
