# Stacks Queues pseudo
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- use a class called PseudoQueue that will implement our standard queue interface. Only using what we created in the stack class and not the queue class.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a new class called pseudo queue.
- Do not use an existing Queue.
- Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
- Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I approached this by using the test to help guide me in what it wants me to do. Also read the instructions on canvas for this challenge.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->

- push
adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.

- pop
Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
Removes the node from the top of the stack
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
