## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach I took was to figure out how create a method to enqueue or dequeue cats and dogs from the shelter if a way that would pass all test too.

## Solution

How to run the code to see if the test pass is pytest -k test_stack_queue_animal_shelter.py
