# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- refers to the number of references the node has

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a Linked List class. Within your Linked List class, include these methods. Insert, include, to string.
- insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- The approach I did was to create the methods that will pass the test.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
- insert will add a new node with that value to the head.
- includes will determine whether a value exists in a node.
- to string will string everything together.
