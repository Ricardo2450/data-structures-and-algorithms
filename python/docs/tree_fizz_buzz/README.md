# Fizz Buzz

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.
- Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
  * If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
  * If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
  * If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
  * If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- The Big O for time and space are O(n). Thats because they both based off the size of the tree.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
How to run the code to see if the test pass is pytest -k test_tree_fizz_buzz.py
