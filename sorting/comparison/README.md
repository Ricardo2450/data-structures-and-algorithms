# sort comparison

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- write functions which sort domain objects. Your functions will receive an array of Movie objects.
Each Movie object has a title (string), a year (number), and a list of genres (array of strings).
One function will sort the movies by most recent year first.
One function will sort the movies, alphabetical by title, but will ignore any leading “A”s, “An”s, or “The”s.
- write tests for your comparator functions.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- ALl I did was write the code for todays code challenge. Will write test later for it.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code -->
- will write test later.
-  pytest -k test_sort_comparison.py
